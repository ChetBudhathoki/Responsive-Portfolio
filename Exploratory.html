                <p>Hi Everyone!</p>
                <p>My name is Chet Budhathoki. I was always fascinated with computer and technology ever since I
                started
                learning computer. Information technology was very foreign to me growing up. There were literally
                handful of
                people who knew how to operate computer let alone Web Development.</p>
                <p>Even though I was interested in computer and IT stuffs, I never too any formal classes. I kept teaching
                myself about hardware, software, and the market trend. Now,
                looking at my interest and the job market, I thought going into IT would definitely make sence.
                Especially
                becoming a Web Developer has a great scope in the job market. Going to school in middle age is kind of
                hard. I have spent several days and hours for this project and still not perfect and I'm myself not
                happy with what I've built.</p>
                <p>Obviously this is a continuously evolving sector. Keep learning and keep growing is my mantra and
                someday I will get there where I wanted to be.</p>
